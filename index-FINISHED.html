  <div class="main-text f5 f4-m f3-l tc pt2"> “In an aggresive tone I began alerting passengers that they should exit the station from the rear gate on platform one and not attempt to enter from front entrance and lobby since there was a problem” recalls Vishnu Zende. He never let on that terrorists
    were in the station. "I was scared, but my voice did not fumble. I do not know how many lives I saved, but I was doing my job." <span></span> </div>

  <div class="main-text f6 f5-m f4-l tc pt1"> On 26/11, the city of Mumbai and its people were under siege for 64 hours. The attacks, which drew widespread global condemnation, began on Wednesday 26 November and lasted until Saturday 29 November 2008. At least 174 people died, including 9 attackers
    and more than 300 were wounded. For hundreds of passengers that evening, returning home to their loved ones looked uncertain. However, amidst the deafening gun shots and a rising pandemonium, some passengers heard the calm voice of a railway announcer
    that guided them to safety. Here is an unbelievable audio account of Vishnu Zende, a regular railway announcer, whose impeccable presence of mind and unwavering voice helped save hundreds of lives during the 26/11 terror attacks.
